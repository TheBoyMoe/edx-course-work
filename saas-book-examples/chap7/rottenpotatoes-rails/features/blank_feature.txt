1. define the feature

Feature: Describe the purpose of the feature

  In order ....
  As a .....
  I want ....

2. define one or more scenarios

Define some specific behaviour to define our feature - through creating one or more scenarios. There are 3 parts to each scenario - GIVEN, THEN and WHEN.
GIVEN - sets up some precondition
WHEN - typically involve simulating the user interacting with the app, e/g, clicking a button, filling in a field.
THEN - usually checks to see if a condition is true
AND - used to extend any WHEN or THEN step to create more complex scenarios

3. run 'cucumber' from the command line

4. define your steps in the steps_definitions file to get them all passing
    - define you steps using regex - allows cucumber to parse your scenarios and call the matching step 

e.g.

Feature: Manage Articles

  In order to make a blog
  As an author
  I want to create and manage articles

  Scenario: Articles List
    Given I have articles titled 'Pizza and Breadsticks'
    When I go to the list of articles
    Then I should see 'Pizza'
    And I should see 'Breadsticks'
