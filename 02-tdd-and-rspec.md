## TDD and RSpec

A good test should be FIRST:
	- Fast
	- Independent
	- Repeatable
	- Self-checking
	- Timely
	
To keep tests fast and independent use 'mocks/doubles' and 'stubs' (all examples of 'seams')  to isolate the behaviour of the code being tested from other classes or methods.

Validation - tests that you built the right thing (BDD)
Verification - tests that the thing works, i.e. it's built correctly (TDD)
