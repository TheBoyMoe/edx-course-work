## Agile Development & Behaviour Driven Design(BDD)

An agile lifecycle starts with BDD - the goal of which is to 'build the right thing'(validation - rather than verification - 'build the thing right).
 - requirements are written as features, each feature is written as a 'user story'
 - the user story describes how the app/feature is expected to be used - 'Acceptance testing'
 - BDD is closely tied to Test Driven Development(TDD) - tests the actual implementation - 'Unit testing'
